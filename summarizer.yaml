## summarizer.yaml
## This file allows excluding specific ESMF hashes and branches and entire machines from 
## the generated test summarization tables.  A * can be used as a wildcard (matches any number of
## characters) in any of the entries.

## !!! anything in include takes priority over exclude !!!
